* Mouse button must be clicked down to change tile colour.

This project provided general prompts but not specific instructions on
'mouseover' events. I decided to implement the check for a mouse button
being clicked in order for a tile colour to change, to allow for greater
control over the ability to draw, by preventing tiles being changed when
simply wanting to move the mouse to a different location on the grid.
